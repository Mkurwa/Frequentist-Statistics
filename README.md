# Frequentist Statistics

The following list includes the topics that these two mini-projects cover:

* the z-statistic
* the t-statistic
* the difference and relationship between the two
* the Central Limit Theorem, its assumptions and consequences
* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample
* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
* how to combine these concepts to calculate confidence intervals and p-values
* how those confidence intervals and p-values allow you to perform hypothesis (or A/B) tests
